            <h2>Reflections on participation and privacy from We Feel Fine</h2>

            <br>

            <p>The main and core inspiration for Beyond Words is the net art project We Feel Fine (www.wefeelfine.org)
                by
                Jonathan Harris and Sep Kamvar. The project scours the internet in search for blog posts containing the
                key
                phrases “I feel” and “I am feeling”, aggregates this information and then transforms it into an artistic
                visual
                representation. The work bears many similarities with ours, there are however a few crucial artistic
                decisions
                on our side which differentiate our project.</p>

            <br>

            <p>Transitioning from this inspiration, Beyond Words takes a different approach. It invites users to
                voluntarily
                contribute their confessions into the artwork, while We Feel Fine automatically aggregates data already
                posted
                across the web. Our digital installation gives the participants a feeling of agency in contributing to
                the
                work,
                rather than having the data taken from them without their consent. The participant contributes their
                emotional
                state through their interaction with the interface of the installation, rather than passively having
                them
                collected without knowledge. Building on this concept, the release of an emotion to the digital universe
                is
                an
                act of cocreation, giving each participant a sense of authorship over the final work. It is also a
                symbolic,
                cathartic act. Behind each star, there is a person, a story, and a confession – even if said confession
                is
                electronically mediated.</p>

            <br>

            <p>Importantly, the confession is facilitated with anonymity in mind. Unlike WFH, which collected the
                gender,
                age,
                location, and in many cases pictures of its participants. None of this is included in Beyond Words, as
                the
                project is not interested in identifying or profiling the authors of submissions. This is a conscious
                design
                decision in order to make the participants more comfortable in sharing their stories, as intimate as
                they
                can
                be.</p>


            <br>


            <p>An important aspect of our work is creating an experience for our participants in exchange for their
                contribution. The galaxy of Beyond Words is deliberately only accessible to people who contribute. We
                invite
                the
                cocreators work to have the chance to experience it, as a token of gratitude for their input. We noted
                that
                this
                was not the case for the people, whose personal statements were fed to the 2006 installation, at least
                not
                by
                design. The two project establish a different relationship, or agreement, with their participants and
                audience.
                For us, they are one and the same, and the journey of each participant starts from the star which they
                created.</p>

            <br>

            <p>Reflecting on the legacy of We Feel Fine, it is evident that with over 12 million emotions on record, it
                is a
                true testament to human diversity, to the richness of human experience across the world and online.
                However,
                almost 20 years later, in a changed internet landscape, the same project reads different. The project
                was
                launched at a time when data analysis was beginning to take pace. Since its launch, the web has
                transformed
                significantly. First, it has grown more personal through the social media boom, then even more so
                through
                targeted advertising, finally leading to data privacy scandals such as Cambridge Analytica and the
                legislative
                countermeasures like the GDPR. In retrospect, WFF precipitates the Internet’s capability to harvest and
                process
                the most intimate details of human experience. It is in essence one of various data mining agents, and
                like
                all
                aggregators, it reduces the published content into the information that is deemed useful for its
                purpose.
                The
                immediate purpose may be artistic, but it is important to recognise that in a capitalist reality, art is
                not
                immune to commercial interests. The book “We Feel Fine: An Almanac of Human Emotion”, released in 2009,
                proves
                the point.</p>

            <br>

            <p>In contrast to this trend, the direction for Beyond Words is to escape from the globally surveilled
                internet
                into a simpler time, when it was viewed as a place where everyone can open up in full anonymity. We know
                well
                that a netizen in 2023 may be wary of sharing their data to a random source, and we ask them to submit
                nothing
                but two pieces of information:</p>

            <br>

            <div class="emphasis">
                <em>How do you feel?</em> &nbsp; <span>and</span> &nbsp; <em>What is the reason of that?</em>
            </div>

            <br><br>

            <h2>Lessons from PostSecret on moderation of user-submitted content</h2>

            <br>

            <p>PostSecret was originally a small community art project back in 2005. Its author, Frank Warren handed out
                self-addressed postcards, inviting local people to anonymously share “artful” secrets that they had
                never
                told
                anyone before. The initiative was more successful than he could ever envisage, and countless secrets
                started
                coming in from across the world. The project soon entered the internet, first as a blog on Blogger, then
                a
                dedicated website (www.postsecret.com), and eventually an app. PS has been a global phenomenon, yet it
                has
                not
                been free of controversies, particularly the app, which had to be taken down a few months following its
                launch.
                Its history is a worthwhile lesson for Beyond Words.</p>

            <br>

            <p>Both projects deal with personal content submitted directly by participants. Unlike the PS blog, which
                regularly
                posts a small portion of selected secrets, the notorious PS app allowed its users the freedom to post
                their
                secrets to the database, all of which could be immediately accessible to the public. The application
                experienced
                an extremely high volume of submissions (over two million), including “content that was not just
                pornographic
                but also gruesome and at times threatening”. Said content represented only 1% of all submissions, yet
                the
                overall volume made it impossible for the team of volunteer moderators working around the clock to
                remove
                offensive content in a timely fashion. The interface allowed users to post pictures, meaning that the
                userbase
                was exposed to pornographic imagery. All this resulted in complaints from users, the intervention of
                Apple,
                law
                enforcement and FBI.</p>

            <br>

            <p>In Beyond Words, the risk of graphic offensive content is averted by limiting user input to text.
                However,
                there
                are other potential issues which our team needs to consider, should the project go public. The users may
                post:</p>
            <br>

            <ul>
                <li>content which is racist, homo- or transphobic, misogynistic, xenophobic, etc;</li>
                <li>content that contains contact details or other personally identifiable information, whether their
                    own or
                    other
                    people’s;</li>
                <li>threats directed at individuals or groups – bullying or harassment;</li>
                <li>content which ignores the instructions (doesn’t contain feelings and reasons);</li>
                <li>content with suicidal ideation or self-harm;</li>
                <li>spam or promotional content;</li>
                <li>content with misinformation or conspiracy theories;</li>
                <li>violent or graphic descriptions;</li>
                <li>hate speech;</li>
                <li>content extremist views;</li>
                <li>sensitive and triggering topics;</li>
                <li>libel, defamation;</li>
                <li>content which encourages illegal activities.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <p>From the practical perspective, AI could help in content moderation, reducing the workload for human
                moderators.
                Even so, however, guidelines for moderation need to be established. The degree of moderation needs to be
                delineated – as with any art project, there is the temptation to allow the contributors complete
                artistic
                freedom. Such freedom, however, can cause harm and bring about legal repercussions. Once it has been
                agreed
                that
                the content should be moderated, there comes the additional challenge of where exactly to draw the line.
                Some of
                the above-mentioned points are more ambiguous than others. For instance, should a participant be
                prevented
                from
                describing their suicidal ideation if it is known that this can trigger suicidal behaviour in some
                participants?
                Content moderation is not limited to censoring submissions, but also entails a sense of responsibility
                towards
                participants. If a user were to post a submission in which they are declaring their intention to commit
                suicide,
                how should the team act? How should the website react to the user declaring that they have committed a
                felony?
                The above considerations are not simply a matter of avoiding legal problems. The intention of Beyond
                Words
                is to
                create a platform where users can feel safe to be vulnerable and express their deepest emotions. This
                objective
                calls for a delicate balance between the freedom of expression and creating a protected environment. Our
                aim
                is
                to foster respect, empathy, and support, and the moderation system should both be sensitive to the
                nuances
                of
                human experience and also guard against content that could undermine the above principles.</p>
